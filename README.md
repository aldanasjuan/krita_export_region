This plugin exports a desired region in the canvas and can optionally resize the export to a new size. 

Please fork for changes. I made this with chatgpt for personal use and I don't have time to do proper open source. I'll ignore issues or feature requests since I'm not a python developer.


## Install

Add the region_exporter folder to the resources folder, like your-resources-folder/pykrita/region_exporter

Add the region_exporter.desktop to the root of the pykrita folder. Should have a file like your-resources-folder/pykrita/region_exporter.desktop

Add the region_exporter.action to an 'actions' folder in the resources folder. Should have it like like your-resources-folder/actions/region_exporter.action

If you don't know what the your-resources-folder folder is, go to krita -> Settings -> Manage Resources -> Open Resource Folder
